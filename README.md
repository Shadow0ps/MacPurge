# MacPurge - Insatiably Destructive Shell Scripts

![MacPurgeLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shadow0ps/MacPurge/master/MacPugeLogo.png)


MacPurge is a script and workflow that I use to purge mac devices. It's meant to be a "last resort" soft reset for people who may be in environments where they are doing research or journalistic endeavors and the data/activities on their machines is sensitive in nature. It's NOT perfect and you should probably back up your device and then test it before you ever attempt to use this in the real world. Please feel free to add your own pieces. You can comment out anything that doesn't apply to you.  If you decide to  use the workflow please edit it to your needs first. The workflow gives you one prompt and if you hit YES it kills all running applications, mutes your audio input and executes the script silently.

# USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! THIS ISN'T FOR "cleaning up your mac" THIS WILL DESTROY DATA AND WIPE OUT MANY IF NOT ALL RECOVERY OPTIONS!
